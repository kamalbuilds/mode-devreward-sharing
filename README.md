# Devfrens on Mode with SFS NFT Fractionalization DApp

Welcome to the SFS NFT Fractionalization DApp! This innovative decentralized application is designed to transform how you manage your Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS) NFTs, allowing you to store, fractionalize, and distribute ownership among your teammates seamlessly.

## Overview

**Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS)** is a groundbreaking mechanism implemented by Mode to reward developers for their contributions to network growth. By sharing a portion of the earned fees with smart contract owners, developers are incentivized to create and maintain valuable applications. This revenue is represented by an SFS NFT, which the owner can claim.

Our DApp empowers you to store your SFS NFTs and fractionalize them into tokens. These tokens can then be distributed among your team members, enabling each individual to claim their corresponding share of the NFT's revenue.

## Features

### 1. **Secure NFT Storage**
   - Safely store your SFS NFTs within our DApp, ensuring they remain secure and easily accessible whenever you need them.

### 2. **Effortless NFT Fractionalization**
   - Easily fractionalize your SFS NFTs into multiple tokens, allowing you to divide the ownership and the associated benefits among multiple parties.

### 3. **Seamless Token Distribution**
   - Distribute the fractionalized tokens to your teammates, enabling each member to claim their respective share of the NFT's revenue.

### 4. **Flexible Withdrawal Options**
   - Withdraw the NFT by owning the total supply of fractionalized tokens, giving you full control over your assets.

### 5. **Integrated Royalty Management**
   - Automatically manage royalty fees during token transfers, ensuring the NFT owner receives their due share without any hassle.
